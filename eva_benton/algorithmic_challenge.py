'''
For the following question, you will be given an unsorted array that may contain duplicates. 
Your job is to write a function that returns true if there are duplicates and false if not.
Then write the time complexity of that function and think of if there are anyways you could have
made the algorithm more efficient?

                return True
    return False


# TODO Write the time complexity
# For this example, I believe the time complexity is O(n^2)

## Bonus!
# Write a function that solves the problem, contains_duplicates in less time 
# (i.e. lower time complexity).
